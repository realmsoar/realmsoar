## Gravity Bubbles
At the center of each ship is a small ore (usually around the size and shape of a football) that has to be kept spinning, which generates a gravity bubble. This ore is mined from deep within the slowly spinning islands, which have their own large bubbles. As these ship-ores are smaller, they must spin very fast.

The gravity bubble points "down" relative to the ship, so everyone stays stable even when the ship is turning. The ore is usually somewhat egg shaped, so the bubble expands just around the bottom and creates a "dome" above the main decks. This ensures that people can work with little risk of falling out or off.

## Gravity Wells


**Core idea 2:** Surrounding ore in magnetic fields create gravitational well, which can be used to move ships:
 - Shape of the well is determined by the shape of the ore
 - Direction of the well is determined by the direction of the magnetic field as experienced by the ore
 - Strength of the well is determined by the mass of the ore and the strength of the magnetic field

These ores, called gravity engines, are attached to ships by chains, and controlled by trained Sky Weavers, who use magic to adjust the fields, resulting in ships that not only float in The Sky, but can *fly*. Different ship designs use different numbers and locations of the engines.
