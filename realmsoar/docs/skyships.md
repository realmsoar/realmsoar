**Aetherium Ore**
## Gravity Bubbles
At the center of each ship is a small ore (usually around the size and shape of a football) that has to be kept spinning, which generates a gravity bubble. This ore is mined from deep within the slowly spinning islands, which have their own large bubbles. As these ship-ores are smaller, they must spin very fast.

The gravity bubble points "down" relative to the ship, so everyone stays stable even when the ship is turning. The ore is usually somewhat egg shaped, so the bubble expands just around the bottom and creates a "dome" above the main decks. This ensures that people can work with little risk of falling out or off.

## Gravity Wells

**Core idea 2:** Surrounding ore in magnetic fields create gravitational well, which can be used to move ships:
 - Shape of the well is determined by the shape of the ore
 - Direction of the well is determined by the direction of the magnetic field as experienced by the ore
 - Strength of the well is determined by the mass of the ore and the strength of the magnetic field

These ores, called gravity engines, are attached to ships by chains, and controlled by trained Sky Weavers, who use magic to adjust the fields, resulting in ships that not only float in The Sky, but can *fly*. Different ship designs use different numbers and locations of the engines.

**Navigational Instruments:**

Navigators on skyships use a combination of magical instruments and traditional methods to plot their course. Astrolabes attuned to the positions of celestial bodies help determine direction, while magical compasses guide them along elemental currents. Special maps detail the complex routes between islands and the specific magical signatures of each region.

**Weather and Storms:**

The weather in the skies can be volatile, with magical storms, wind currents, and unpredictable phenomena. Skyships are equipped with protective wards and enchantments to withstand these conditions. Experienced captains learn to read the signs of the skies to anticipate weather changes and potential hazards.

**Aerial Combat:**

Skyships engage in thrilling aerial battles using a combination of magical weaponry and strategic maneuvers. Elemental cannons shoot blasts of magical energy, while skyboarders and aerial defenders fight hand-to-hand. Captains coordinate their crews to evade enemy fire and strategically position the ship for optimal advantage.

**Floating Islands and Moorings:**

Floating islands serve as both natural landmarks and mooring points for skyships. Each island has designated docking areas where skyships can land and anchor themselves. Platforms, cranes, and magic-powered elevators facilitate the transfer of goods and passengers between ship and land.

**Magical Phenomena:**

The skies are home to various magical phenomena, from shimmering auras that provide temporary boosts to propulsion, to mysterious rifts that could lead to hidden realms. Players might encounter enchanted creatures, volatile elemental nodes, or ancient sky temples harboring ancient secrets.
