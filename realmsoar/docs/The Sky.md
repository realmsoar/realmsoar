## Layers of the Sky

The Sky is generally accepted to be comprised of seven layers. From highest to lowest, they are:
1. **The Heavens:** This is where the sun and the moon fly, and above them yet, the stars (believed to be glowing islands) shine at night.
2. **The Thin Sky:** This is sky that is too high to fly in. Some islands dot this layer (it is generally accepted that The Thin Sky stops at the highest island), but they tend to be on the smaller side.
3. **The High Sky:** This is a range of The Sky that is too high for most people to live in - although the [[Kalari]] and [[Sylvan Drifters]] are able - but most people are able to come and go from it in short bursts. Breathing is harder here for most people. It's around a half mile in depth.
4. **The Middle Sky:** This is where most people live and travel. Breathing is comfortable here. It's around a mile in depth.
5. **The Low Sky:**  This is a range of The Sky that is too low for people to live in, although [[Dwarven Cloudborn]] can spend longer here than most, and it's generally though that the [[Tarkur Reavers]]can stay here indefinitely. The air is thick, making breathing harder, and moving through it requires more effort.
6. **The Thick Sky:** This is sky that is too thick - something like liquid water - to fly in. Like the Thin Sky, people can see some island here, and while they are larger than most, they appear barren.
7. **The Deeps:** This is an area that people can see only with telescopes and other remove devices, as the clouds are thick and billowing. It's believed by some that The Sky becomes solid, as water becomes ice, if you go deep enough.
## Islands

There is no gravity in The Sky. Islands do not exist in a single "plane" but can be found at differing heights, all slowly spinning what we would call "clockwise", but the people of Realmsoar call that direction "rockwise". This spinning creates a downward gravity due to the [[Sky Ships]] core that islands have. Different islands spin at different speeds, with smaller islands generally spinning slower, or having lighter gravity.

Islands in explored regions of the Sky - the [[Sky Alliance]]'s Core Region, or the [[Aetherian Imperium]], come in a range of sizes with a fairly predictable pattern relating their frequency to their size.
 - **Uncountable Tiny Islands:** too small to put a building on
 - **Hundreds of Small Islands:** can fit a house and farm space
 - **Dozens of Medium Islands:** Can support a village of a dozen families 
 - **Maybe a Dozen Large Islands:** Can support city of a few hundred people, like [[Nova Spire]]
 - **Just a Few Huge Islands:** These are legendary locations - there supposedly exists an island far from the [[Sky Alliance]] with a pool of water so large you cannot see one side from the other.

Most Small Islands that have people on them tend to be tall - like columns or spikes - or have a lighter gravity.
