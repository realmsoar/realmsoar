**Laws of Aetherium Rotation:**
1. The shape of the ore defines the shape of the bubble
2. The axis of rotation defines the direction of gravity (aka the "right hand rule")
3. The size of the bubble is in proportion to the product of the rotational speed and the mass of the ore
4. The strength of the gravity is in proportion to the density of the ore


**Core idea 2:** Surrounding ore in magnetic fields create gravitational well, which can be used to move ships:
 - Shape of the well is determined by the shape of the ore
 - Direction of the well is determined by the direction of the magnetic field as experienced by the ore
 - Strength of the well is determined by the mass of the ore and the strength of the magnetic field
