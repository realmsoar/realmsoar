When creating a Fellowship and Character in Fantasy World, several things tie the group and character to the world.
## Sample Fellowship Archetypes
### Shields
 - **Authorities**: The PCs are the leaders or key members of a fort on a frontier island, on the edge of the known sky or between two factions (Scope: Low Borns)
### Knives
 - **Rebel Scum**: The PCs are leaders of an underground resistance movement deep in the [[Ascendant Domain]], [[Void Syndicate]] Space, or even the [[Aetherian Imperium]]or [[Sky Alliance]], working to keep the local population safe (Scope: Street Underdogs)
### Hearts
 - **Seekers**: A [[Sky Alliance]] (spearheaded) team seeking knowledge of the Luminaries, legendary beings who created the first Sky Ships (Scope: Adventurers)
### Coins
 - **Mercenaries**: A group of  ex-soldiers and other individuals looking to live a free life in the Sky. (Scope: Any)
## Blood
From "Peoples":
 - [[Aeran Mystics]]
 - [[Aetherbound]]
 - [[Dwarven Cloudborn]]
 - [[Gnomish Skytinkers]]
 - [[Sky Elves]]
 - [[Sylvan Drifters]]
### Kin

Two kins relate to a faction, and two do not.

 - **Citizen**: You grew up on an island controlled by the [[Sky Alliance]], [[Aetherian Imperium]], or other Faction of Realmspire.
	 - Why did you leave? Was there a falling out, or are you welcome to return?
	 - Who did you leave behind?
 - **Steader**: You come from a small sky island not actively under the scope of a major faction.
	 - What custom is unique to your home island? Do you still follow it?
	 - What will draw you back home one day, or keep you away?
 - **Agent**: You're an active force for a faction, although that fact may not be known outside your Fellowship.
	 - What goals does your Faction expect from you?
	 - What aspect of your Faction keeps you at arms length, in the sky?
 - **Nomad**: You were born on a ship, and even though your family's ship is on other clouds, you'll always be at home in the skies.
	 - What skywork you do better than anyone else in the Fellowship?
	 - What aspect of the islands is your greatest source of discomfort?
